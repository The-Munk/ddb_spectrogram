This Fork
====================
This project has been inactive for a very long time. I didn't make it, I just forked it and hacked it. That's what this page you're on is - a hack of a seemingly abandoned project. I've changed some deeper things not exposed by basic settings. I may continue to change more.

## Building / Installation

I don't know the deps for your system, but it's pretty light.

You can figure it out. I believe in you.


run `make` to build

run `./userinstall.sh` to install

run `./userremove.sh` to remove
